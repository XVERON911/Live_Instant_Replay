# 🎥 Live Instant Replay (LIR)

Live Instant Replay (LIR) is a lightweight Windows tool that shows an **instant replay** of the last *X seconds* of gameplay — right on your screen — without having to alt-tab or leave the game.

Perfect for gamers, streamers, or content creators who want to quickly review or react to clutch plays, fails, or epic moments while staying immersed in-game.
